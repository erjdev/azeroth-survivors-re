# Survivors implementation contract

This plan implements [the Armory specification](SURVIVORS.md) and its
[intention images](intentions/). It is a work breakdown and acceptance contract, not a
replacement design or a claim that the illustrated game already exists. Git records
completed changes. Each phase must pass its acceptance criteria before it is called done.

## Architecture and ownership

The game is local simulation in Rust, on Bevy 0.18.1 and wgpu 27. The
`warcraft-survivors` launcher calls into `benilla-app`; Survivors owns its mode under
`crates/benilla-app/src/survivors/`. Native Bevy UI and the existing glue widgets draw
menus. MPQ archives, DBC catalogs, item displays, models, icons and terrain come from the
player's read-only 1.12.1 install. There is no gameplay server for this mode.
Do not replace the menu with a website or bundle reference art as runtime assets.

Keep changes in Survivors-owned files. Reuse `benilla-world`, the model attachment
systems, glue art, tooltip primitives, and catalog loaders through their existing
interfaces. Any necessary upstream carry must obey AGENTS.md. Native is the daily loop;
wasm uses the same rules with the existing web entry and platform persistence seams.

## Existing foundations and remaining gaps

The three-column Armory door, twelve-zone registry, locked-zone explanations, a 54-cell
collection save, three saved specs, real Talent.dbc presentation, achievement categories,
perks, companion controls, tabard selection, jewelry catalogs, and combat already exist.
They must be extended rather than replaced with independent copies.

The collection currently names nine common items and a legendary main hand per class.
The other bands are incomplete. Strongest-owned gear supplies stats automatically; there
is no independently chosen worn loadout and appearance loadout. Collection and drop pages
remain predominantly text. Most campaign zones lack complete verified content. Talent
points feed generic tree bonuses rather than the promised individual spell behaviors.
A visible control or stored field alone is not a completed feature.

Two correctness gaps precede expansion: settlement credits the first hero of a class
instead of the selected hero, and displayed drop times are disconnected from the periodic
boss scheduler (the advertised 16-minute drop exceeds the 15-minute victory timer).

## Rule decisions

Preserve waves, horde counts, level-up drafts, chest trades, renown and relics until an
explicit replacement exists. Keep permanent class collection separate from run jewelry.
A class has nine equipment slots and six collection bands: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic,
PvP, Legendary. Two-handed weapons consume only main hand. Only worn gear affects stats;
cosmetic overrides and tabards never do. A full worn nine-slot set earns its bonus.

One hundred talent experience earns one point, capped at 51. Each hero stores three
independent specs. Tree rows require earlier-row investment; refunds must not strand
higher rows or prerequisite talents. Milestones at 10/20/30 must change actual abilities.

The screenshots and prose conflict on duplicate bonuses and the breadth of extra targets.
Those two decisions need user resolution; independent work can proceed. Until resolved,
retain existing mechanics rather than silently change balance. Screenshot sample totals
are illustrative, never fabricated progress. Item/creature names pictured on a different
map require verified substitutions documented in the catalog, not invented assets.

Unspecified balance coefficients are implementation decisions: centralize and document
them, test monotonicity/caps, and distinguish them from numbers explicitly specified by the
references. Talent XP must eventually incorporate survival time, kills, defeated bosses,
win, later-zone scaling and Veteran's Lessons. Spawned bosses are not defeated bosses. Initial tuning retains the level × 2, kills / 10
and win 40 (loss 8) base, adds one XP per ten survived seconds and ten per defeated
boss, then adds 10% per later campaign zone. The award is capped by the hero's 51-point
limit. Catch-up compares the best hero of the class with the best hero of the account.

## Phase 1 — progression integrity

1. Credit the selected valid hero at settlement; handle absent/stale/wrong-class selections
   without corrupting another class. Keep class-wide drops and clears class-wide.
2. Make rewards idempotent for repeated settlement, and cap XP without integer overflow.
3. Use one campaign encounter schedule for displayed times and actual spawns. Resolve
   names against the map roster. A missing encounter must prevent content readiness.
4. End campaign runs only when the final scheduled boss can actually be defeated. Preserve
   the non-campaign arena timer where no campaign schedule exists.
5. Count defeated bosses separately and implement the documented XP inputs and catch-up.

Acceptance: selected second hero receives rewards, first hero does not; repeat settlement
cannot pay twice; save/reload preserves rewards. Every listed encounter spawns exactly
once at its listed threshold, including across a large time step. Final drops remain
obtainable; dead heroes cannot win simultaneously. UI and combat use the same drop odds.

## Phase 2 — equipment and persistence

Add per-class selected gear for all nine slots, with explicit empty slots. Migrate old
saves to their former strongest-owned loadout once. New drops fill an empty slot but do
not replace a deliberate choice. Reject unowned, invalid-slot and out-of-range choices.
Store appearance separately: worn item, a collected override, or hidden. Validate all
save references, preserve old heroes/specs/achievements, and retain dirty state after a
failed write. Keep saves under the existing local-state resolver.

Acceptance: choosing a lower-quality piece changes combat and displayed totals; owning a
stronger piece alone does not. Unequipping removes its stats and a full-set bonus. Duplicate
handling follows the resolved rule. Cosmetic changes never alter stats. Class isolation,
legacy migration, malformed references and round trips have regression tests.

## Phase 3 — collection and character surfaces

Build the nine-by-six collection grid with quality headers, owned/unseen states and
selected-item detail. Use catalog-backed item icons, names, source, chance, stats, worn
state and appearance controls. Show real collection counts, never 54 named placeholders.
Character has appearance controls, equipment, summed bonuses, and a rotatable dressed
paper doll. Share selected hero/race/sex/features with the existing appearance flow.
Use the reference gold/black frame, spacing, hierarchy and readable scroll behavior.

Acceptance: every owned cell can be inspected and equipped; worn and cosmetic changes
appear on the paper doll and in a run; tooltips remain inside the viewport. Test empty,
partial and full accounts at 1280×720 and 1920×1080 plus UI scaling. Compare screenshots
with the intention images; compilation alone does not establish visual completion.

## Phase 4 — all twelve zones and gear content

Complete the ordered path in SURVIVORS.md. For each zone, verify terrain/map coordinates,
creature displays, named encounter roster, schedule, boss, slot/band drops and class item
mapping. Connect item ids to names/icons/displays from available catalogs. Fill all 54
cells for each of nine classes with verified content. Content readiness is derived from
these dependencies rather than a trusted boolean. Never unlock a label with no world.

Acceptance: every zone is traversable after its previous clear and talent gate; every
piece has an obtainable source and every source resolves to a scheduled creature. New
accounts start in Elwynn; old clears retain stable identities. Drop Tables and actual
awards read one catalog, including Keen Eye. Verify each world location against game data.

## Phase 5 — talents that change play

Keep three real named class trees and three saved specs. Define explicit supported talent
and milestone effects against Survivors abilities. Use vanilla rank patterns and row
requirements while following the named Survivors milestone design. Implement each effect
through shared combat/stat calculations, not tooltip-only prose. Paladin's named milestones
are the first vertical slice; then cover every class. Surface effects and selected spec
on the door and run sheet. Preserve migration from the skeleton arrays.

Acceptance: each selectable talent has a documented implemented effect; 10/20/30 milestone
threshold tests and representative combat tests prove those behaviors. Switching specs
changes the next run without losing either spread. Free reset and right-click refund keep
all dependency constraints valid. No points leak across heroes.

## Phase 6 — codex, achievements and rewards

Turn jewelry lists into icon grids with details and unseen states. Expand only with actual
implemented offers; ensure every legendary amulet maps to a class ability and seen status
persists when dealt, including abandoned runs. Provide achievement summary, recent earns,
five categories, progress and total points calculated from the catalog. Expand feats with
real content. Finish reward pips, costs, two perk refunds, shared point economy, verified
companion looks, distinct instincts and cosmetic tabards.

Acceptance: purchases and refunds cannot duplicate points or reset companion investment;
perks change the described run behavior; companions fetch coins/wisps without opening
chests or behaving like a magnet. All cosmetics use verified displays. Totals reconcile
across tabs, saves and achievements; locked rows explain requirements.

## Phase 7 — integration and visual acceptance

Finish the shared frame and all reference layouts, including Done, Run Options, zone title
on Enter World, equipment bonuses and class/race identity. Test first launch, existing
save, creation, appearance, selected spec, locked/open zones, start/pause/abandon/death/win,
reward settlement, restart and reload. Resolve overflow and keyboard/mouse focus; typing
must not accidentally start a run. Missing art/data should produce an honest usable state.

Run the native play-profile build (`cargo survivors-build`), focused Survivors tests,
`scripts/check.sh`, and wasm check where the wasm toolchain is available. Run repository
land gates before landing a PR. Record actual results and limitations in commit/PR text,
not a claim of passing from code inspection. No auto-merge or deployment is part of this
implementation task.

## Evidence and completion

Each phase needs rule tests, save migration coverage where applicable, and an integration
check of the user-visible effect. Use seeded data for probabilistic boundary tests rather
than flaky sampling. Do not write fixtures into the player's save or install. Keep tests
independent of a real install where possible; explicitly report data-dependent skips.

Full completion means all seven phases satisfy their acceptance criteria and all intended
screens and mechanics work together. Missing game data, unverified assets, unresolved
mechanics or unavailable rendering evidence remain open requirements; they are not grounds
to mark the full goal complete. Progress check-ins should name completed behavior, evidence,
and the next unresolved dependency. Commit coherent verified pieces on the implementation
branch as the user requested.
